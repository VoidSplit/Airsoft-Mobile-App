# What's Airsoft Maker?

Originally, Airsoft Maker was supposed to be a 3d airsoft gun viewer application allowing you to view your replica with different accessories and different camouflages and in different situations (in a building, in a forest, etc.).

But from now on, Airsoft Maker is supposed to be an ultra complete application intended to be used by airsofters and event organizers in order to have additional functionality during the game and its organization.

# What are the features?
- A forum with diff√©rents topics.
- A section to organize a game and to join it.
